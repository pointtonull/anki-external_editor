# External Editor for Anki

![Editing](/screenshots/editing.png)

Replaces built-in html editor with the one of your choice.

I created this add-on because I spent lot of time copying from Anki to
vim, editing, and copying back.

It allows you to specify your editor of preference.

# Installation

In Anki 2.1, menu: *Tools/Add-ons*, click *Get Add-ons...*, and enter:
```
704320065
```

Restart Anki to finish installation.

You can change the editor by clicking in "Config".
